Yes, Elasticsearch can be deployed using Docker. Here's a basic guide to get you started with Elasticsearch using Docker:

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.

### Steps to Deploy Elasticsearch with Docker

1. **Pull the Elasticsearch Docker image:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to pull the official Elasticsearch Docker image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull elasticsearch:8.8.0
   ```
   Replace `8.8.0` with the desired version of Elasticsearch.

2. **Run the Elasticsearch container:**
   Use the following command to run an Elasticsearch container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:8.8.0
   ```
   - `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
   - `--name` assigns a name to the container.
   - `-p 9200:9200` maps port 9200 on the Docker host to port 9200 in the container (for HTTP API).
   - `-p 9300:9300` maps port 9300 on the Docker host to port 9300 in the container (for transport client).
   - `-e "discovery.type=single-node"` sets the environment variable to run Elasticsearch in single-node mode.

3. **Verify the Elasticsearch container is running:**
   You can check the status of the container using:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   This command lists all running containers.

4. **Access Elasticsearch:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9200`. You should see a JSON response from Elasticsearch indicating that it is running.

### Example `docker-compose.yml` for Elasticsearch

If you prefer using Docker Compose, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:8.8.0
    container_name: elasticsearch
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
      - "9300:9300"
    volumes:
      - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

volumes:
  esdata:
    driver: local
```

Run the following command to start Elasticsearch with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
